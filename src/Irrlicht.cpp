/** Example 007 Collision

We will describe 2 methods: Automatic collision detection for moving through
3d worlds with stair climbing and sliding, and manual scene node and triangle
picking using a ray.  In this case, we will use a ray coming out from the
camera, but you can use any ray.

To start, we take the program from tutorial 2, which loads and displays a
quake 3 level. We will use the level to walk in it and to pick triangles from.
In addition we'll place 3 animated models into it for triangle picking. The
following code starts up the engine and loads the level, as per tutorial 2.

	So far so good, we've loaded the quake 3 level like in tutorial 2. Now,
	here comes something different: We create a triangle selector. A
	triangle selector is a class which can fetch the triangles from scene
	nodes for doing different things with them, for example collision
	detection. There are different triangle selectors, and all can be
	created with the ISceneManager. In this example, we create an
	OctreeTriangleSelector, which optimizes the triangle output a little
	bit by reducing it like an octree. This is very useful for huge meshes
	like quake 3 levels. After we created the triangle selector, we attach
	it to the q3node. This is not necessary, but in this way, we do not
	need to care for the selector, for example dropping it after we do not
	need it anymore.
